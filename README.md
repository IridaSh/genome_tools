This project analyzes patterns in three-dimensional protein structures by identifying pairs of amino acids that are at least 100 residues apart in the linear sequence but are within 10 Angstroms in 3D space. The goal is to determine if certain amino acid pairs occur more or less frequently than expected by random chance based on the amino acid composition of the set of proteins.
